# C++ Algorithm Challenges

This repository contains C++ programs that solve 
different problems. Each program 
is accompanied by questions to challenge your 
understanding of algorithms and programming concepts.

## Questions for Code Files

### 1. printName.cpp
**Question:** Write a program that takes a user's name 
as input and prints it out in reverse order. Consider how you 
would handle names with multiple spaces or special characters.

### 2. ReadNameandPrintit.cpp
**Question:** Write a program that reads a full name
(first, middle, and last name) and prints each part of 
the name separately. Consider edge cases where the user 
might input extra spaces or only provide a single name.

### 3. CheckNuberEven_Odd.cpp
**Question:** Write a program that checks whether a number 
is even or odd without using the modulus operator (`%`). Explore
alternative methods such as bitwise operators.

### 4. HireDriver.cpp
**Question:** Write a program that automates the process of hiring
a driver based on certain criteria (e.g., age, experience, driving record).
The program should evaluate multiple candidates and recommend the best one.

### 5. RecommandationHiring.cpp
**Question:** Write a program that takes a list of candidates with their 
qualificationsand recommends the top three candidates for hiring. 
The program should prioritize candidates based on experience and qualifications,
but also account for diversity factors (e.g., age, location, or specialization).
